# Lab Module 10 - Final Project - Training Guide

**NOTE:** Be sure to implement all the Lab Module 10 requirements listed at [Lab Module 10](https://github.com/programming-digital-twins/pdt-exercise-tasks/issues/18).


## Overview

**INSTRUCTIONS:** Create a brief, one-page 'training rubric', where you navigate your virtual space, explaining to a trainee what you're doing, how the components work, and what they're for.
- Copy this file to a new file within your `./Assets/BuildingDigitalTwins/Docs` directory as part of your {DTA_HOME} folder.
  - BDT_TrainingGuide_LabModule10.md

- FIll in the details specified in the `Final Project Description` section below.

- Key points to cover in the training guide:
  - **WHAT** your application / training video does (e.g., what use case it implements)
  - **WHY** this use case is important (e.g., helps the user understand {something} and practice {something else})
  - **HOW** it works (i.e., a detailed walk-through of how the components work and what each is for)

- Execute your application and record your interaction in much the same manner as in Lab Module 09. Optionally, create a voice over track for the video.
  - The video must be demonstrated during final in-class presentations.
  - The video does NOT need to be submitted, however, it must be created and part of your demo.

- Submit the `BDT_TrainingGuide_LabModule10.md` to the LMS for this assignment.
  - This can be PDF, RTF, PNG, or a hyperlink to the Markdown as long as it's accessible for review by TA_TEAM and PROF.



## Final Project Description

### What - About your Digital Twin App 

- What does this application do?


- What use case does it implement?



### Why - Who Cares? 

- Why do you care about this particular problem?


- Why do you think this problem matters to others?



### How - About your Design and Implementation

#### Summary

- What is the overall system flow?


- What are the Core Digital Twin Components used?


- How do the Core Digital Twin Components interact?



#### System Diagram

**NOTE:** Embed a block diagram depicting your overall design, including each EDA instance and the DTA, along with the communication mechanism(s) used.



#### How is Data Generated?

**NOTE:** Briefly discuss how data is generated (e.g., from which sources - simulated, emulated, physical system)



#### How are Commands Processed?

Briefly discuss how commands are processed from the DTA to one or more EDA instances.
